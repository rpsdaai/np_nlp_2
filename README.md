The objective is to implement a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to create an English language character generator capable of building semi-coherent English sentences from scratch, by building them up character-by-character.  For training the model, we will use the complete version of J. K. Rowling’s book “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets”.
